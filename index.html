            The United Kingdom’s (UK) economy is facing the worst recession in decades. Like other countries in the world, the main
            reason for this is the outbreak of COVID-19. However, another uncertainty from an attempt to find a new
            trade deal with the European Union (EU) after Brexit, made its economic recovery more unclear.
            ‘International trade’ is an aspect which can reflect a recession of the UK economy amid this chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, there was a negative sign in the UK economy since before the outbreak of COVID-19 and before the
            Brexit day. The previous prediction in 2019 from the Bank of England (BoE) indicated that growth of the UK
            economy in 2020 was expected to be lower than two percentage points mainly due to weakening global growth
            and Brexit-related uncertainties. Now it seems to be getting worse due to uncertainties in post-Brexit era
            and the impact of COVID-19, especially when focusing on trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            International trade is an essential part of the UK economy. According to data from the UK’s Office for
            National Statistics (ONS), the UK total trade in 2019 was worth 1,407.3 billion pounds, or equal to almost
            two-thirds of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). Nowadays, uncertainty in the future relationship
            with the EU after Brexit day is one of the critical concerns for the UK. The EU, as a whole, was the biggest
            trade partner of the UK in the year ending September 2019 from the ONS data. Hence, the transition period,
            which will last long until at least 31 December 2020, is the time when people keep an eye on a new trade
            agreement negotiation between both sides.

            However, Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform, said in a webinar ‘Brexit in times
            of Coronavirus’ hosted by GLOBSEC think-tank that the transition period should be extended. His reasons are
            lack of trade deal negotiators during COVID-19 outbreak, and a possible big hit in GDP in case of no-deal
            Brexit.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The business community is gonna take a big hit from coronavirus. The government shouldn’t give it another
            big hit from Brexit,” said Charles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The uncertainty on business investment and capital deepening during this transition process makes the UK’s
            Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated that productivity to date will be affected 1.4 percentage
            points. The OBR also indicated that the UK will face higher non-tariff barriers on its trade with the EU,
            and following impacts including lower imports and exports, more decreasing productivity, and GDP loss after
            the transition period. The level of these barriers and effects depends on whether the UK will agree on a
            trade deal with the EU or not. Moreover, if there is no trade deal agreed, the tariff is another thing that
            will come into force.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, COVID-19 has now become another factor which affects the UK and global trade. The
            international monetary fund (IMF) revealed its prediction on 14 April 2020 that the growth of the UK economy
            will shrink by 6.5 percentage points in 2020. Furthermore, the imports and exports volume in advanced
            economies, including the UK, will fall by 11.5 and 12.8 percentage points respectively.

            Max Munday, the director of Welsh Economy Research Unit at Cardiff Business school, also clarified in an
            interview about how economic loss is connected to poorer trading conditions during COVID-19, especially in
            most of the major industrial nations including the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You’ve had a drop in demand for goods and services across all the major economies, and you’ve got a drop in
            consumer expenditure across all of those major nations that could have quite a dramatic effect on trade,”
            said Professor Munday. He also added that in the short term, decreasing productivity in the UK from low
            demand during COVID-19 outbreak may affect the international competitiveness of the country if other
            countries bounce back from the crisis stronger than the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important point is, most of the UK’s top trading partners including USA, China, Italy, Spain, and
            France, are in the top ranks of countries which have the most cases and deaths from COVID-19 and are facing
            disruption. From explanation by the IMF, domestic disruptions in each country, including disrupted supply
            chains, lower productivity or even job losses, spill over to trading partners through trade and global value
            chain linkages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, the concrete effects of COVID-19 have been gradually revealed. A survey conducted by the ONS
            during 9-22 March 2020 indicated that 59 per cent of importers and 57 per cent of exporters across the UK
            accepted that COVID-19 affected their businesses. However, this number of import and export businesses
            covered only around one-third of all business responded to the survey. Although the UK government has
            launched measures to help both workers and businesses get through this difficult time including a loan
            scheme, a statutory sick Pay rebate scheme, and VAT deferral, using money in these measures means a sharp
            increase in public sector borrowing and net debt. The OBR expected public sector debt surpasses 100 per cent
            of GDP during the year, but it will drop sharply when the UK economy recovers. Patrick Minford, a Professor
            of Applied Economics at Cardiff Business School, said in an interview that he believes the government’s debt
            will fall in value in the marketplace after the COVID-19 crisis due to higher interests’ rate in that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IMF still expects the UK trade and economic growth to recover again from the third quarter of 2020.
            However, it warned that global growth recovery is still ‘uncertain’ and depends on pandemic fading. While
            the interim outlook from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published on 2
            March described that the higher costs for service exports and non-tariff administrative barriers will be
            main factors which will restrain the growth and the exports of the UK in 2021 even though a basic free trade
            agreement between the UK and the EU will come into force smoothly from the start of 2021. Besides, there are
            other downside risks which could make the situation deteriorate, including a failure to set up this basic
            free trade agreement and the more intensive, or prolonged impact of COVID-19. Additionally, in Professor
            Minford’s opinion, the level of impact on the economy depends on when the lockdown will be lifted. The more
            quickly the lockdown is finished, the less damage to the UK economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I think it’s unthinkable really for it to go on beyond the middle of May because it is so destructive to
            the economy. Many businesses won’t come back, and you will see a lot of people will lose their jobs as
            well,” said Professor Minford.
